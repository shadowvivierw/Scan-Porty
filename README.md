A simple TCP port scanner written in Python. It prints a banner and then checks whether a specific port is open on the given host.

## Usage

```bash
python3 scan-port.py <host> <port>
```

Example:

```bash
python3 scan-port.py example.com 22
```

If the port is reachable, the script will print that the port is open; otherwise it will report it as closed.
